## Run locally with docker

Use docker-compose
```
docker compose up

```
If you get an error that says "Error response from daemon: Duplicate mount point:"

```
docker compose down

```
Then try the 'up' command again!

## Run the flask app outside docker

Bring up the MySQL DB container
```
docker compose up -d db
```

Install requirements.
`mypy` takes some time to install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Initialise environment variables. The `.env` is used in `docker-compose.yml`.
```
export FLASK_APP="src/main.py"
export SECRET_KEY="cool_app_bro"
export MYSQL_HOST="127.0.0.1:5432"
export MYSQL_DB="mydb"
export MYSQL_USER="postgres"
export MYSQL_PASSWORD="example"
```

Run flask
```
# initialise environment variables
flask run
```

## Run tests

```
py.test -vv
```


## Run with gunicorn
For production.
```
cd src && gunicorn main:app
```

## Continuous Deployment Pipeline

We're utilizing a continuous deployment pipeline where all merges on the 'main' branch are 'automagically' deployed into production. When a PR is opened, you'll have a 'staging' URL to view and check for accuracy.
